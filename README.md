<h2>A <b>free</b> hybrid auth plugin for bungeecord</h2>
<br><br>
It automatically logs in premium players, only cracked players need to login manually
<br><br>
It is very simple to use, Just put the plugin in your bungeecord server, configure the mysql database and then put it in hub servers and auth servers as well
<br><br>
It also has a lot of configurable options in the config.yml in bungeecord
There is no config for the backend servers, everything can be configured directly in the bungeecord server reducing a lot of hassle for all server owners :smile:
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
- Discord 2fa <br>
- HubServer and authserver balancing <br>
- Logs in premium players without showing anything about authentication <br>
- Backup Server system <br>
- Can AutoUpgrade cracked players to premium. <br>
- Configurable Messages <br>
- Strong Discord 2fa Integration <br>


<h4>Important Points</h4>
- This plugin does not allow cracked players with premium names to join
<br>
- Premium players will always be logged in automatically

<h3>More features will be added soon!</h3>
